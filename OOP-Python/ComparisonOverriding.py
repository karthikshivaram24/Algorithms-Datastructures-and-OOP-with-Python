"""
This file just shows if we have to compare 2 objects based on their field values
how we could override the equals method for the Object within the class of the object.

here the method to override would be :

1) __eq__ for the equals method (==)
2) __ne__ for not equals (!=)
3) __lt__ for less than (<)
4) __gt__ for greater than (>)
5) __le__ for less than or equal to (<=)
6) __ge__ for greater than or equal to (>=)

** IMPORTANT ** Always use "isinstance(object,class)" method to verify if the object is same type of the class
